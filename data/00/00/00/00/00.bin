  |   pattern of her panties. Pantsu Hunter: Back to the 90s is an          |
  |   adventure game with point-n-click elements (with a risk of swift      |

  |   Kenji Kojima, a young and able enthusiast, leaves his home province   |
  |   to attend university in the capital. Without the help of his          |
  |   parents, it's difficult to live and study, so he begins learning      |
  |   different occupations until he eventually becomes a true handyman.    |
  |   However, academic qualifications aren't his priority in life - it's   |
  |   finding true love! Unfortunately, it's not that simple. To his aid    |
  |   have come the most unexpected of all things: Panties! Kenji has       |
  |   learned how to identify a girl's personality by her underwear and     |
  |   he'll meet four girls on his way: a playful sweetheart, a pretty      |
  |   tomboy, a shy introvert and an icy beauty. Can he eventually find     |
  |   his true love?                                                        |
